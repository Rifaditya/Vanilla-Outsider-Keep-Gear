brainstorming categories to expand the mod:

1. ⚖️ Dynamic Balancing (Risk vs. Reward)
~~Enchantment Weight: Higher-level enchantments (like Sharpness V or Protection IV) could cause the item to take a slightly higher durability penalty. It's "heavier" for the soul to carry back from the afterlife.~~
Distance-Based Penalty: The further away you die from your world spawn or bed, the higher the durability penalty (scaling from 1.2% up to maybe 5%).
Soul Fatigue: A brief 30-second debuff on respawn (Weakness or Slowness) if a certain amount of gear was saved, simulating the "exhaustion" of keeping your items.
2. 🪄 "Vanilla+" Mechanics
~~Echo Shard Use-Case: Make Echo Shards useful! If you have Echo Shards in your inventory, one is consumed on death to completely negate the durability penalty for that death. It fits the "Deep Dark/Death" lore perfectly.~~
Soulbound Infusion: A late-game mechanic where you can combine an item with a Netherstir/Soul Sand in a Smithing Table to give it a "Soulbound" property, making it take 0 penalty on death.
XP Banking: Instead of just keeping 20%, allow players to "store" XP in a new block or item, but only the stored portion is 100% safe.
3. ✨ Immersion & Visual Polish
The "Ghost" Effect: When you respawn with saved gear, the items could have a subtle "translucent/blue" tint in the hotbar for the first 5 seconds, slowly fading back to normal as they "materialize."
Custom Death Message: Instead of just "Steve fell from a high place," the mod could add a follow-up: "The soul clung to Steve's Netherite Sword."
Durability Warning: A chat warning if an item is so low on durability that one more death will break and lose it.
4. 🎛️ Expanded Configuration
Cause-Specific Rules: A table where users can define different rules for different deaths.
Lava Death: 5% penalty.
Fall Damage: 1% penalty.
Creeper: 10% penalty (explosions are harsh!).
Curse Overhaul: A config to make Curse of Binding items always drop (as a way to get rid of them) even if the mod is on.
5. 📦 Container Handling
Bundle Logic: If you carry a Bundle, does the bundle stay while the items fall out? Or does the whole "package" stay together? Adding a toggle for "Bundle Protection" would be a cool niche feature.
Which of these directions feels most like "Vanilla Outsider" to you? Personally, I think the Echo Shard integration (Idea #2) is very "Vanilla+" because it gives a semi-useless vanilla item a major new purpose.
